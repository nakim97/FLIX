### Notes
Overall I found the walkthrough videos to be easy to understand and insightful, as I was able to learn a lot about Swift and Xcode. While working on the project, I did struggle a bit on trying to understand the template for the ViewController where we had to code in Swift. While Swift is a bit similar to Javascript, I am still new to IOS development so trying to understand the logic behind the process was a bit difficult. A problem that had me stumped for a few hours was trying to properly commit the project to GIT. I kept running into the same error (pathsec) and it turns out all I needed to do was restart my computer for the push to go through successfully. For the first project, I had a lot of fun building it and I look forward to adding new features in the upcoming weeks!
